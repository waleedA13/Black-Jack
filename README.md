# Black Jack

Black Jack is a card game where there are two players. The dealer gives each player 2 cards. If the two cards add up to 21, then they automatically win. They can pull a card if they are under 21, and whoever is closer to 21 wins. If either gets over 21, the other player wins.

Ace can either be considered to be a point or 11 points.
Jack, Queen, and King are 10 points.
